  - I previously used an Apple Studio Display, which I'll likely be selling. The Studio Display is a beautiful monitor but the lack of support for other input sources simply became too limiting for me. Rather than doing some kind of Rube Goldberg setup to connect my gaming PC to it, I just went with a _really_ great PC monitor instead and I don't miss the studio display at all.

  - Light bars above monitors are the kind of thing you never think you need until you get one, then you simply cannot imagine ever not having one. There are lots of good ones out there, I like this one because the controller puck is wireless.

# On The Go

## Tech

_As you can probably tell, I'm all-in on the Apple platform. For me, it just works how I want my gear to work and I love how seamlessly things like AirPods and AirTags work together with my phone, tablet, and Mac_

- **Phone:** iPhone 16 Pro Max
- **Primary Tablet:** M4 iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard and Apple Pencil Pro
- [Kobo Libra 2 e-reader](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-2)
  - I previously used and really liked a Kindle e-reader, but I don't love how locked-down Amazon has made their ecosystem and I prefer the ergonomics of the Kobo Libra. Physical page-turn buttons are essential for me.
- AirPods Pro 2 in-ear headphones
- Airpods Max over-ear headphones

## Photography

- [Fujifilm X100 VI digital camera](https://www.fujifilm-x.com/en-us/products/cameras/x100vi/)

Photography is a new hobby for me and one that I'm slowly finding my footing with. I chose the X100 VI partially because I love the aesthetics of it but mostly for it's size and simplicity. It is small enough to carry around in my purse or jacket pocket and the lack of
interchangeable lenses is actually a plus for me, as it makes me focus on the fundamentals of framing a shot and not worrying about using the perfect lens. My Fuji is perfect for street photography, casual pics of friends, and general day-to-day use.

## Bags

_I'm a bit of a bag nerd and change up my bags more regularly than any sane person should. This is my current rotation_

- **Work Backpack:** [Bellroy Tokyo Totepack](https://bellroy.com/products/tokyo-totepack?color=deep_plum&material=baida_ripstop&size=15in#slide-0)
- **Weekend Bag:** [Tom Bihn Maker's Bag](https://www.tombihn.com/products/the-makers-bag?variant=43536926671037)
- **Purse:** [Bellroy Tokyo Crossbody](https://bellroy.com/products/tokyo-crossbody?color=deep_plum&material=baida_ripstop#slide-0)
- **Gym Bag:** [Aer Gym Duffle 3](https://aersf.com/collections/duffels/products/gym-duffel-3?country=US)

For me, the work backpack is for my day job. I basically only use it when I'm commuting to and from my day job. The Tokyo Totepack is the perfect size for my 16" work laptop and core accessories (like an umbrella, chargers, small bag of cosmetics, etc.).

My "weekend bag" is what I bring with me on urban adventures outside of work. It's perfect for throwing in my iPad, a book or my e-reader, some water, and my camera.
