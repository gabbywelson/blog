# What the heck is a colophon?

Basically a colophon is a term borrowed from the publishing world. It's a page that details _how_ a book was published, ranging from the location to the font choices/typesetting and other details. In a web context, a colophon just talks about how a site was made! A lot of indie sites I admire have them so I decided to make one too!

# How this site is made

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org) with the App Router as the framework
- [React 19](https://react.dev) for components and interactivity
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Fraunces](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fraunces) as the serif font for headings
- [Geist](https://vercel.com/font) as the sans-serif body font
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) for code blocks
- MDX for content and writing, powered by [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote)
- [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes) for the theme switcher (light, dark, and retro modes!)
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) for icons
- TypeScript for type safety
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for deployment and hosting
- pnpm as the package manager
