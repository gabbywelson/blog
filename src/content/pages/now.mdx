title: "Now"
excerpt: "What I'm up to right now."
---

- I'm renting a house with Becca and working on lots of small home organization
  projects. I'm also slowly but surely turning every light bulb in the house into
  a smart bulb and working on setting up Home Assistant.
- At work I recently joined a small team working on a new project. I can't say much
  about it right now, but it's exciting and I'm having lots of fun building something totally
  new with some very talented teammates.
- Speaking of work, I came out as Gabby to my colleagues recently and have been _loving_ that
  I don't need to effectively live a "double life" every day where I'm out socially but not at work.
  I had lots of anxiety about telling colleagues but in reality it was _very_ uneventful and everyone
  has been tremendously kind and supportive.
- A few months ago I bought a Fuji X100VI and have been trying to use it more and more.
  I don't really know what I'm doing right now, but eventually I'm excited to start sharing some of my
  photography here.
- Becca and I have been taking cooking classes at a wonderful little local cooking school. I wish
  I had more time to cook on a daily basis, but learning new skills in a class setting has been fun and humbling. It turns out
  I've been holding a chef's knife wrong my whole life!
- I recently joined a gym near my office and am excited to start going regularly again.
