## Here's a few things about me:

- I live on the west coast but New England will always be home 🌲
- I'm a software engineer passionate about making products that help people👩‍💻
- I'm a queer trans woman and use she/her/hers pronouns 🏳️‍⚧️
- I'm a cat mom to two little gremlins who I love very dearly 🐱
- I love coffee ☕, craft cocktails 🍸, and trying all kinds of food 🍴

## Here's a rough timeline of things I've done personally & professionally:

- **2011 - 2015** - Student at **Williams College**
  - I majored in political science but took a range of classes — from legal theory to the history and culture of French wines!
  - From **2013-2014** I was extremely fortunate to study at Exter College at the **University of Oxford** as a visiting student in the Williams-Exeter Programme
  - In **2015** I got my first taste of programming with _Diving Into the Deluge of Data_, an introductory computer science course teaching the fundamentals of programming through working with data in Python. It was great!
- **2015 - 2019** - Living and working in Vermont
  - For much of this time I was a **business analyst** at Middlebury Interactive Languages, an EdTech company that helped K-12 students learn foreign languages. It was fun! It also gave me an opportunity to apply some Python skills to my day to day work, deepening my love of programming
  - I briefly worked in marketing and community outreach for a solar company which felt great and let me spend a lot of time out in the sun
  - I also freelanced as a tutor and education consultant, helping students apply to colleges
- **2019** - Learning software engineering
  - I moved to **Austin, Texas** and did a full-stack software engineering bootcamp through **Hack Reactor.** It changed my life!
  - I learned everything from jQuery to React Native, built a ton of full-stack apps, and made some life-long friends
- **2019 - 2024** - Working at LinkedIn
  - I moved to the Bay Area and started as an **apprentice engineer** at LinkedIn through REACH, their job targeted at bootcamp grads and self-taught engineers.
  - Eventually I was able to grow into a **software engineer** and then a **senior software engineer,** doing various product work across a few teams in LinkedIn's Feed org.
  - I'm most proud of the **accessibility (a11y)** work I did at LinkedIn, helping to make the feed a more accessible user experience for everyone. I was also extremely fortunate to work on hiring, recruiting, and mentorship for the REACH Apprenticeship, helping more engineers from non-traditional backgrounds find their footing and launch their careers.
- **2025 - now** - Working at Handshake
  - I can't say much about it, but I'm working on an awesome internal startup at Handshake as a **founding engineer** and having a blast!
