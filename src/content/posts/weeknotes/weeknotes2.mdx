Another week, another week notes. I’m really enjoying this new practice.

**Rose 🌹** Without a doubt the highlight of the week was my birthday dinner at kiln here in San Francisco. It was an absolutely incredible meal and I wish I could go back for more. I wrote up a little bit about it [here](/notes/kiln-review). Thank you to my amazing partner Becca for such a generous and thoughtful and wonderful gift 💜

**Thorn 🥀** The low point of the week was probably just some general lethargy and feeling “blergh” this weekend. I think in large part it was due to a very over-indulgent dinner for my birthday on Thursday. Yesterday, for example, I had to leave a house party early due to just not feeling very well. I’m hoping I can strike a better balance with foodie indulgences in the future.

**Bud 🌷** This coming Friday I’ll be going to an art class with Becca as a date night. I’m really excited to learn a new skill and go outside of my comfort zone a bit.

## Things I did

- I was finally able to share a little bit publicly about what my team at Handshake AI is building. In short, we’re making a platform to generate “human data” that AI labs can use for making their models better at various topics. Handshake is in a really unique position to do this well and I’m super grateful that I’ve had the opportunity to work on the team as a Founding Engineer. It’s crazy to think about how much we’ve grown already and the exciting road ahead.
- I signed up for [Math Academy](https://www.mathacademy.com), which is kind of like Duolingo for math. It has a bunch of K-12 courses for younger learners but it _also_ has a whole series of content for adult learners wanting to get back into math and eventually explore more college-level topics. I’ve been wanting to brush up on math skills for a while so I’m super excited to chip away at this and learn some new stuff in my spare time[^1].
- Celebrated my birthday, as I wrote about above
- Had an awesome personal training session that kicked my butt in a good way

## Media from the week

- [God Is Hungry For Context](https://www.latent.space/p/o3-pro?open=false) - a quick review of the new O3 Pro model from OpenAI. I haven’t had a chance to use it myself, but this _sort_ of thing (feeding it tons and tons of context and meeting notes and having it generate plans) is really interesting to me and something I hope I can play around with more some day
- I don’t have one “best” link from the week, but there was a _lot_ of great content about Apple’s annual WWDC developer conference. I’m really torn about Liquid Glass, their new design language. On the one hand it looks _gorgeous_ but there is a real concern about accessibility and how it will actually perform in the “real world” with a range of different kinds of background content. I’m not yet brave enough to install the developer betas on my devices, so I’ll just eagerly await the public betas before drawing my own conclusions.

## Website changelog

- I’m not directly linking to it anywhere yet, but I added a [**notes**](/notes) route for posting things that don’t really feel like blog posts but are still things I want to post (e.g. restaurant reviews, random thoughts, etc.). I’ll probably play more with this over time
- It isn’t really a website change _per se_ but but I managed to get a pretty good setup in place on my iPad Pro that allows me to write posts for the site (using the app iA Writer), commit them with Git (through the app Working Copy), and then preview the builds using Vercel. It’s a pretty nice workflow that will enable me to get a lot more done on just my iPad!
