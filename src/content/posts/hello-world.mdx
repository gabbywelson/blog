# Hello World

Welcome to my digital garden — a space where thoughts bloom and ideas take root.

## What is a Digital Garden?

Unlike a traditional blog with polished, finished posts, a digital garden is a collection of evolving ideas. Some notes are seedlings, just planted and barely sprouted. Others are evergreen, well-tended thoughts that have matured over time.

> "A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness; it teaches industry and thrift; above all it teaches entire trust." — Gertrude Jekyll

## What You'll Find Here

This space will grow to include:

- **Technical explorations** — deep dives into code, architecture, and the craft of building software
- **Personal reflections** — thoughts on life, learning, and the journey
- **Creative experiments** — projects, ideas, and things I'm tinkering with

## The Stack

This site is built with:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS v4",
  content: "MDX",
  hosting: "Vercel",
  vibe: "Soft Digital Garden"
};
```

## Let's Grow Together

Thanks for stopping by. Feel free to explore, and don't be surprised if things change — that's the nature of a garden.
